First time using an API. Chose to use an Accuweather API for an website that would show:

1. Default background image;
2. Input for city or zipcode;
3. Search button;
4. Temperature; 
5. Temperature icon;
6. Windspeed;
7. Humidity;
8. Background for weather condition.

All of this in a display box. 
Beauty.
